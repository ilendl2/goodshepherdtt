title: Youth Group

The youths of the parish have organized themselves into a youth group to foster greater participation in the life of the church. This group has been recently reestablished in November 2018 and comprise approximately 25 youths that will represent the parish and the North East region in parish and regional activities.  The group has elected its executives and we look forward to them building up the Anglican communion.  All youths are encouraged to be a part of this movement.
