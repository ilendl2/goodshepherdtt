title: Lay Ministers
---
The laity of the church are all members who are not part of the clergy, usually including any non-ordained members of religious institutes.  Lay persons are therefore authorized by a bishop in the Anglican Communion to lead certain services of worship or lead certain parts of a service. They are members of the congregation permitted to preach and preside at some services, but not called to ordained ministry.  Lay ministers are comprised of both men and women and  have responsibility for the following as outlined in the Lay Ministerâ€™s Manual

* Conducting Mattins, Evensong, and Compline (BCP) or a service of the word (Common Worship)
* Reciting the Litany
* Act as the liturgical deacon at the Eucharist
* Preaching, teaching, and assisting in pastoral care
Distributing (though not presiding at) Holy Communion.
* Participation at other services as requested 

In Good Shepherd, lay ministers lead the congregation in Morning prayers and ably assist our parish priest with a variety of duties at Good Shepherd and also at St. Oswalds.  Once a month, lay ministers regularly deliver communion to many of our elderly parishioners who are unable to physically attend mass.  There are currently only 6 lay ministers and there is an urgent need for more  persons to be called for service in the church in a deeper way. 

Please contact the parish priest if you are interested in becoming a lay minister.
