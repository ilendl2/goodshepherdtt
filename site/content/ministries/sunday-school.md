title: Sunday School
---
Sunday School is held every Sunday morning during the 7:00 a.m. service. Children are welcome and a very important part of the parish of Good Shepherd. During service, school-aged children between the ages of 4 and 12 are invited by the Sunday School coordinator Aunty Renee Lovell to the conference room for lessons with Sunday school teachers. The curriculum includes Bible stories, games and crafts.

Once a month (usually the fourth Sunday), children fully participate in youth led services. There are currently over 80 children that attend weekly services and Sunday school and regularly participate in: 
* Vacation Bible School held in July each year
* Nativity Play
* Mothers Union Easter Parade and  other competitions
* Confirmation classes
* Bible Quizzes
* Nine Lessons and Carols
* Field trips 

All young parishioners are encouraged to regularly attend Sunday school as this is an important foundation for Christian life.  Parents and grandparents are particularly encouraged to support this ministry. Please contact Renee Lovell at 231-9130 if you wish to know of the various ways you can play a more active role in supporting the Sunday School as a parent and/or Sunday school teacher and/or well-wisher.
