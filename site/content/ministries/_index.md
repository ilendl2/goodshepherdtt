  We will be updating the Good Shepherd Sermon archive with the Word and Wisdom
  delivered from the pulpit at Good Shepherd and St Oswald by our parish priest
  and guest preachers. From high feast days to our regular services, memorials
  to special services we hope these sermons continue to inspire days, months,
  and years later.
