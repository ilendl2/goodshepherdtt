  We will be updating the Good Shepherd Sermon archive with the Word and Wisdom delivered from the pulpit at Good Shepherd and St Oswald by our parish priest and guest preachers. From high feast days to our regular services, memorials to special services we hope these sermons continue to inspire days, months, and years later.
