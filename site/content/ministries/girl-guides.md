The Girl Guides Association of Trinidad and Tobago is part of a world-wide organization with over one hundred and fifty (150) countries and 10 million girls. Once you become a Girl Guide you are set for life in that you are taught life-long skills, moral and ethical values, indoor and outdoor skills.  You travel the world and visit our five (5) world centers situated in England, Mexico, India, Switzerland and Africa.

Girls can join the movement from 6 years upwards.  There is no age limit. The 1st Tunapuna Unit was opened on 7th April 1943 by Ann Whilmenia Murray (also known as Teacher Thynnie) at the Tunapuna Anglican School now called the Good Shepherd Anglican Primary School.  In April of 2019 the unit celebrated seventy five (75) years of unbroken service.

The 1st Tunapuna Unit meets every Saturday evening at 4:00 pm at the Good Shepherd Anglican Primary school.
