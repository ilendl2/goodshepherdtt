title: Ushers
---
Ushers play an important role in welcoming church members and visitors to the church.  Ushers are always on hand before church begins to ensure that church bulletins and choir booklets and hymnals are distributed,  visitors are assisted, questions are answered and the congregation is seated.  Ushers regularly assist in services and generally ensure that the church service runs smoothly. 

The Good Shepherd Usher group has 12 members and welcomes new members to the fold.

Please contact Eula Reid Mayo at   for more information on how to join this ministry.
