title: Survivors Group
---
THE Survivors Group was formed in 2018 in response to the need for fellowship and support among those parishioners who have lost loved ones.  The group currently comprises xxxx persons, among whom there is a lawyer, medical practitioner, and psychologist.  The group meets to provide counselling to members and to assist families in need. 

The group meets once a month.  If you are interested in lending support, please contact Jacqueline Roach-Sarjeant at 663-6992.
