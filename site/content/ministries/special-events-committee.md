The Special Events Committee has been established for quite a number of  years, formed to embark on projects that will assist in the financial upkeep of the church.  This group annually manages fund raising activities such as the following:
* Palm Sunday concert
* Mothersâ€™ Day Extravaganza
* Good Shepherd Family Day
* Curry Que
* Emancipation Galore
* Harvest Celebrations

The committee currently meets twice a month. The committee welcomes individuals who can lend their talents and skills in producing events that will support the mission of the church.

Please contact Dave James at 762-9902 if you would like to join this group.
