Objectives of the Society: 
* To band churchmen together in a common effort, to promote the glory of God and help forward the work of the church.
* To deepen the spiritual life of its members.
* To encourage the reading and systematic study of the Holy Bible.
* To uphold the Christian standard of marriage and family life and to emphasize the responsibility of fatherhood.
* To promote fellowship, not only within society itself and among church people but also as far as possible with all Christian people and men of goodwill.
* To emphasize that the principles of Christianity must be applied to all human relations.
