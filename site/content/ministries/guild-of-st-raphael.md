title: Guild of St Raphael
---
The Guild of St Raphael is dedicated to promoting, supporting and practicing Christ's ministry of healing, looking not just for physical healing, but for the healing of the whole person. The Guild is also concerned with  the healing of communities and of God's creation itself - taking into account those many social and political factors which cause 'dis-ease' in our broken and divided world.

Prayer for healing is at the heart of the Guild's work, as are the sacraments of healing - anointing and the sacramental act of the laying on of hands. But members make use of other healing actions as well - the ministry of listening and silence, counselling, informal liturgies and simple symbolic actions.

In Good Shepherd, the Guild of St. Raphael is a long-established group, as in October of 2019 they will celebrate 64 years in existence.  The group currently has 4 members and is desperate need of new membership and revival as over the years many have become infirmed. Members continue to  participate in mass, serve breakfasts on 2nd Sundays of every month and visit the sick and shut ins in the community and in the hospitals.
