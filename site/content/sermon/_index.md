  We will be updating the Good Shepherd Sermon archive with the Word and Wisdom
  delivered from the pulpit at Good Shepherd and St Oswald by our parish priest
  and guest preachers. From high feast days to our regular services, memorials
  to special services we hope these sermons continue to inspire days, months,
  and years later.

      A sermon delivered at our 2018 Harvest Thanksgiving. The occasion also
      marked the first Church Service at our newly restored Church building. The
      Archdeacon links the Parable of the Weeds to contemporary events including
      the issue of the appropriate strategy for crime and policing in Trinidad
      and Tobago.
