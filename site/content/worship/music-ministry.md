> Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth! Serve the Lord with gladness! Come into his presence with singing! â€“ Psalm 100

Music is an integral part of our worship at Good Shepherd, and we are supremely blessed to have an extraordinary team of singers and musicians who lead us in worship. The Good Shepherd Music Ministry co-ordinator is Mr. Dane Goodridge.
