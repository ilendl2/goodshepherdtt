#### Good Shepherd, Tunapuna

![Worship at the Big Tent](/img/big-tent-experience.jpg)

Our historic Church building is currently undergoing [extensive renovation work](/donate.html). As a result, our services are now been conducted in a large tent on the eastern side of the Church grounds. The Good Shepherd "Big Tent" has caught the imagination of both parishoners and visitors alike. Some are saying that it is adds a biblical dimension to worship at Good Shepherd. Indeed, [Archdeacon Baldeo](/about_us/clergy.html) has drawn a parallel to the **Calling of Abram** in the Book of Genesis:

> From there Abram moved on to the hill country east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel to the west and Ai to the east. There he built an altar to the LORD, and he called on the name of the LORD - Genesis 12:8.

Learn more about the theological significance of the tent in this wonderful sermon delivered by Archdeacon Baldeo to mark the first celebration of the Holy Eucharist at our "Big Tent" (June 17, 2018).
