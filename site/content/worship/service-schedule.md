#### Holy Eucharist

All are invited to share in the Bread and Wine, the Body and Blood of Christ, at God’s Table, the Altar. You are welcome here! You do not have to be an Anglican to receive Holy Communion, once you are a Communicant in your own Church you are welcome to share the Sacrament of Holy Communion at Good Shepherd. If you choose not to receive, you are invited forward for a blessing. If someone cannot come to the church to receive the Eucharist due to illness or some other reason, please contact us at 663-2153 or [rector@goodshepherdtt.org](mailto:rector@goodshepherdtt.org). Arrangement will be made for the Priest of Lay Minister to administer sick communion.

#### Morning Prayer

Morning Prayer takes place at Good Shepherd, Tunapuna twice a week on Sunday at 6.45 and on Tuesdays at 6 am. These services use time-honoured forms, along with readings from the Bible and the meditative readings of the Psalms to allow scripture to deepen our prayerful relationship with God.
